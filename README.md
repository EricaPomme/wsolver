# Wordle Solver

A truly lazy and useless blob of code.

## Usage

Script takes two arguments:  
  
1. any letters you have positions of, with any non-letter character to fill the unknown spaces.
2. any letters you know aren't valid, just kind of vomited onto the command line

## Example

```
$> python3 solver.py .ie.e qbvrx
kieye
liege
lieue
niece
piete
siege
```
